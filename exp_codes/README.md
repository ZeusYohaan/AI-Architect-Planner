## How wall_filter (in detect.py) works

### Initial Thresholding:
The first step is to convert the grayscale image into a binary image. This is done by setting a threshold. Pixels with values above the threshold become black, and those below become white. In this case, Otsu's method is used to automatically determine an optimal threshold.

### Noise Removal:
After thresholding, there might be small unwanted specks or noise in the binary image. The code uses a mathematical operation called "opening" to get rid of this noise. Opening is like a filter that removes small blobs while preserving larger connected regions.

### Dilation for Enhancing Walls:
Dilation is a process that expands the black regions in the image. In this case, it's applied to the binary image to make the walls thicker and more prominent. This helps in creating a better representation of the wall regions.

### Distance Transform:
The distance transform is a way to measure how far each pixel is from the nearest boundary. It is useful for estimating the width of objects in the image. Here, it's used to get an approximate width of the walls.

### Thresholding for Sure Foreground:
Another thresholding operation is performed on the distance-transformed image to identify pixels that are very likely to belong to walls. This creates a "sure foreground" mask, highlighting regions with a high confidence of being part of a wall.

### Subtraction to Find Unknown Regions:
By subtracting the sure foreground from the dilated image, you get the "unknown" regions. These are areas where the algorithm is not completely sure if they belong to the wall or not. It helps to identify regions that need further analysis.


In summary, the code goes through a series of operations to clean up the image, enhance the wall features, and identify regions with high confidence of being walls. The unknown regions are then extracted for further consideration. This approach is common in image processing to segment and identify specific features in images.
